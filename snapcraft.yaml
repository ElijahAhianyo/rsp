summary: Rapid SSH Proxy.
description: |
  rsp is a SSH client which implements SOCKS5 proxy feature of SSH protocol. 
  Key feature of this implementation is use of multiple connections to 
  overcome downsides of multiplexing many tunneled TCP connections in single 
  SSH session. Multiple sessions are not limited with TCP window size of 
  single connection and packet loss does not affect all tunneled connections 
  at once. In order to cut latency of connection establishment rsp maintains 
  pool of steady connections, which replenished with configurable rate.
